# Changelog
On this page you can see the changes made to our app over time. New versions, bug fixes, and more are listed here.

<br>

# **Version 1.1.3**
Sorry for the wait, but here’s a release focused on usability!
We updated the Caravan list. Now you get more focus on the image and more spacing between items. It’s never fun to squint to see something, right?
We also show your passenger’s photo both in the Passenger list and in your Caravan detail screen.
In addition, some bugs were fixed to improve overall usability.

More coming soon!

<br>

# **Version 1.1.2**
We lowered the required iOS version from 17.0 to 16.6!
An onboarding flow was added on the first launch of the app to briefly explain its features. It’s also accessible from the Settings screen.
Now, the Privacy Policy and Support screens open inside the app instead of opening a native browser window.

<br>

# **Version 1.1.1**
Usability improvements focused on simplicity and efficiency. In this version:
- Added pull to refresh on the Caravan and Passenger lists, improving the experience when using iCloud sync.
- The keyboard now dismisses on forms when the screen is moved.
- Improvements to the Settings screen UI with icons for a better experience.
